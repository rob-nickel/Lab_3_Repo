                          I am a mentoring-focused Self Engineering Leadership Fellow currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Kansas (3.5+ GPA). I have strong interests in teaching, predictive algorithms, mobile app development, vexillology, and collegiate sports. In order to inspire a passion for computing in younger students and further develop my own skills, last summer I was a Computer Science instructor for iD Technology Camps at UMKC, and am one of three chairmen for the KU School of Engineering's High School Design Competition. This event is the largest annual recruitment event for the school bringing in almost 50 schools and well over 200 students.
                          <br>
                          Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven leadership, analytical, and organizational skills, which I hope to use while tackling any problem.
